> Quality bar for issues users and maintainers actually want.

- Begin immediately on first message; no “what do you want to do?”.
- Always check for repo templates and duplicates before drafting.
- Lead with **WHO is affected** and **WHEN**; keep examples concrete.
- Verify claims against code (paths/lines/values), not vibes.
- Titles: concise, problem-focused (e.g., “Dark theme: submit button invisible on hover”).
- Prefer minimal templates when none exist; don’t overwhelm non-contributors.
- If contributor intent is expressed, append scoped technical details and acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then).

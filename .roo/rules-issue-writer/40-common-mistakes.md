> Avoid these failure modes.

### Mode Initialization
- Asking what to do; waiting for “create an issue”.
- Not starting repo detection and discovery instantly.

### Problem Reporting
- Vague text, no steps or impact; wrong/missing labels; no duplicate check.

### Workflow
- Forcing contributor-level details on reporters.
- Ignoring repo templates/metadata; over-complex forms.
- Requiring acceptance criteria from non-contributors.

### Technical Analysis
- Not tracing data end-to-end; proposing new systems where a variable reuse suffices; suggesting patterns that diverge from the codebase.

> Investigation quality bar.

## Process
- Be methodical; never skip the **disprove** step.
- Embrace iteration: each search should refine or refute the current hypothesis.
- Maintain and update the TODO list; treat it as the investigation ledger.

## Searching
- Start broad (issue terms), then add concrete code identifiers surfaced by results.
- Avoid generic queries (“error”) without context.

## Quality Checklist
- Extracted all relevant keywords.
- Performed ≥2 rounds of searches.
- Genuinely attempted to disprove the primary hypothesis.
- The proposed solution is clearly marked **theoretical**, not definitive.
- Draft reads conversationally, minimal jargon, easy to scan.

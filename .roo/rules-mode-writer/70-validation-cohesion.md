> Cohesion checks to prevent contradictions.

- **Comprehensive review** across YAML + rules; unify terminology.
- **Aggressive questioning** where ambiguity exists (supply concrete options).
- **Contradiction detection**: permissions vs instructions, conflicting workflows, role vs capability.
- **Post‑change validation**: structural (names, tags), content (role/whenToUse), integration (handoffs, overlaps).
